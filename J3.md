1. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. We can use this to create a single method such as totalArea(Shape shape) that works with multiple shape objects. This method will call the appropriate area() implementation based on the shape. 

2. The program utilizes polymorphism by storing different object types (Point, LabPoint, String, Scanner) in a single variable u of type Object. When u.toString() is called, it invokes the toString() method defined in the respective class of the actual object stored in u. 

3. A. Class D inherits from C, which inherits from A. The toString() method in D calls super.toString(), which calls C’s toString(), which in turn calls A’s toString(). Therefore, the result is A.

4. ~~B~~ ~~B~~ The toString() method in class B calls fancyToString(). Since this refers to a B object, it invokes B’s fancyToString() method, resulting in ~~B~~. Even when cast as an A object, the toString() method called will still be the overridden version in B.

5. A A. The toString() method in B is not overridden, so calling toString() on a B object will use A’s toString() method, which returns A.

6. The code will not compile because A is not implementing the get_name() method properly. 

7. A: 1. The get_alphabet_position() method in A returns 1, and the get_name() method is now properly declared, so the program compiles and prints A: 1.

11. 
A class is a blueprint for creating objects and can contain concrete methods with implementations while an abstract class cannot be instantiated and can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.

accelerate() and brake() vary for every car so they can be abstract methods while startEngine and stopEngine() are rather common so they are concrete methods - implemented classes.
